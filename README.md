# Stock_Analysis

##Overview of Project: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
This analysis was conducted to analyze the stock market and what different green energy stocks
they can invest in. While analyzing the returns for Daqo New Energy Corporation, we also
analyzed a handful of other green energy stocks which include hyrdoelectricity,
wind energy, geothermal energy and bioenergy. In order to reduce the amount of human error and
be able to analyze many more rows of data with ease, we used VBA's to iterate through
the green energy stocks provided and returned the total daily volume of the stock based on it's
ticker as well as the returns for the year. 


Results: Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.

Based on the analysis, it can be seen that the return of investment for green energy was siginificantly better than that of 2018. In 2017
Summary: In a summary statement, address the following questions.
What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
